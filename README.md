## Known Issues and Fixes

### "No Requests Found" Issue (May 22, 2025)

#### Problem
The extension started displaying "No requests found" in the popup, even when user messages were present in the chat on `https://grok.com`. This issue occurred because the changing of the DOM structure, breaking the selector used to detect user messages.

#### Cause
The original selector in `content.js` (`div.items-end div.message-bubble`) no longer matched user messages due to a website update. The updated DOM structure for a user message was:

```html
<div class="relative group flex flex-col justify-center w-full max-w-3xl md:px-4 pb-2 gap-1 items-end">
    <div dir="auto" class="message-bubble rounded-3xl prose dark:prose-invert break-words text-primary min-h-7 ...">
        <div class="thinking-container"></div>
        <div class="response-content-markdown ...">
            <p dir="auto" class="break-words" style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hello, Grok!</p>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
```

The selector needed to adapt to this new hierarchy, targeting `div.items-end .message-bubble` and extracting text from the nested `<p>` tag.

#### Fix

The issue was resolved by updating the selector in `content.js` to match the new DOM structure. The updated code in `indexRequests` is:

```js
const userMessages = document.querySelectorAll('div.items-end .message-bubble');
```

Text extraction was also adjusted to target the `<p>` tag within `response-content-markdown`:

```js
const textElement = msg.querySelector('div.response-content-markdown p') || msg;
const text = (textElement.textContent || '').trim().replace(/\s+/g, ' ').slice(0, 100);
```

This fix was implemented on May 22, 2025, and the extension now correctly indexes user messages.
